# Mental_Health_Analysis_using_SVM

This project analyzes mental health survey data using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. Both **Linear** and **Polynomial kernel SVMs** are applied to classify mental health status based on demographic and lifestyle features. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation, with comparisons between linear and non-linear models of SVM.

The primary goal of this project is to explore how different SVM kernels, particularly the Polynomial kernel, can capture non-linear relationships in mental health data, and compare their performance to a Linear SVM.
